Crypto Update CLI Project

- I'm also going to put the text below on my blog
  with some more extra cool content so stay tuned for that

I decided to create a CLI to be able to look up the coin prices in my turminal when I am coding.
Which was the genius of this project.

So the over all plan for this project is as follows:

1. Make a cli that gets data from a main crypto exchange / site resource
2. Populate the terminal with up to date information about their favorate crypto asset
3. enable user to be able to choose from the top 100 crypto
assets to see more detailed information about that coin


The way that I will get the data that I need is scrape the site: https://info.binance.com/en
It's where I usually get information about the price of a coin.

At this point of the project Im proplex about what data that I am interested in seeing.
I only care about a few things: the coins - name, price, 24 hour change, market cap to start.

I want to be able to see
